# proton-gist

Easily submit gists from within your [Atom](http://atom.io) editor.

Will take the content of the currently active editor window and post it as an anonymous gist, once the gist is created the link is automatically added to your clipboard.
Also it uses the name of the current file (*untitled* for non-saved files) as the file name for the gist, so named files will use correct highlighting when viewed.
